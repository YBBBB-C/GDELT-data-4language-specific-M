suggest: 
1. Instead of predicting GCAM, it is better to directly replace the GCAM function - use LLM embedding + classification to make a smarter emotion recognizer
2. Run summarisation on different language versions of the same article, then analyse what varies â€” is it just word choice or is there deeper bias or content difference?
3. Construct parallel data for classification model stability -->it is more important to summarize the differences in language alignment in the task
